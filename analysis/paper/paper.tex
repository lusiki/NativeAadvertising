  \begin{abstract}
  This research focuses on analyzing the content elements of native
  advertisements on the most popular Croatian online portals, with the
  aim of identifying key characteristics of headlines and content, as
  well as their correlation with audience reach. The study was conducted
  on a sample of 543 native ads published on six leading Croatian online
  portals from December 2021 to May 2022. The content analysis method
  was used, focusing on two general categories: headline characteristics
  and content characteristics. The analysis found that nearly 80\% of
  the headlines had at least one clickbait characteristic, with the most
  commonly used styles including uncertainty (44.38\%), use of numbers
  (9.39\%), and emphasis on emotions (5.89\%). The headlines were
  predominantly declarative sentences, with one-fifth being
  interrogative sentences, while the connection between the ad headline
  and the advertiser's brand name was very rarely present. In terms of
  content, visual elements were present in all ads, with photographs
  being the dominant element, and visual identity elements of the
  advertiser, such as logos, were included in 34.44\% of the ads.
  Regarding sources in native ads, 47.33\% of the ads did not use
  statements, while the most common sources were individuals from the
  organization (19.71\%). Statements from direct users of the products
  or services were present in 6.81\% of the cases, while statements from
  brand ambassadors and influencers were present in smaller percentages
  (4.79\% and 3.5\%, respectively). These findings highlight the
  dominance of clickbait headlines and the importance of visual identity
  in native advertising, while direct brand association and the use of
  various sources, including direct users, appear less frequently. A
  comparison of different types of headlines and sources with ad reach
  indicates specific practices in native advertising across different
  industries.

Please make sure that your manuscript follows the guidelines in the
Guide for Authors of the relevant journal. It is not necessary to
typeset your manuscript in exactly the same way as an article, unless
you are submitting to a camera-ready copy (CRC) journal.

For detailed instructions regarding the elsevier article class, see
\url{https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/latex-instructions}

\hypertarget{bibliography-styles}{%
\section{Bibliography styles}\label{bibliography-styles}}

Here are two sample references: \citeauthor{Feynman1963118}
\citetext{\citeyear{Feynman1963118}; \citealp{Dirac1953888}}.

By default, natbib will be used with the \texttt{authoryear} style, set
in \texttt{classoption} variable in YAML and with
\texttt{elsearticle-harv.bst} which is among provided style by
\texttt{elsarticle} documentclass. Other available style are
\texttt{elsarticle-num.bst} and \texttt{elsarticle-num-names.bst} ---
the first one can be used for the numbered scheme, second one for
numbered with new options of natbib.sty.

You can sets extra options with \texttt{natbiboptions} variable in YAML
header. Example

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{natbiboptions}\KeywordTok{:}\AttributeTok{ longnamesfirst,angle,semicolon}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There are various more specific bibliography styles available at
\url{https://support.stmdocs.in/wiki/index.php?title=Model-wise_bibliographic_style_files}.
To use one of these, add it in the header using, for example,
\texttt{biblio-style:\ model1-num-names}.

\hypertarget{using-csl}{%
\subsection{Using CSL}\label{using-csl}}

If \texttt{citation\_package} is set to \texttt{default} in
\texttt{elsevier\_article()}, then pandoc is used for citations instead
of \texttt{natbib}. In this case, the \texttt{csl} option is used to
format the references. Alternative \texttt{csl} files are available from
\url{https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=elsevier}. These can be downloaded
and stored locally, or the url can be used as in the example header.

\hypertarget{equations}{%
\section{Equations}\label{equations}}

Here is an equation: \[ 
  f_{X}(x) = \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right)
  \left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha-1}
  e^{-\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha}}; 
  \alpha,\beta,x > 0 .
\]

Here is another: \begin{align}
  a^2+b^2=c^2.
\end{align}

Inline equations: \(\sum_{i = 2}^\infty\{\alpha_i^\beta\}\)

Tables can also be generated using R chunks, as shown in Table
\ref{tab1} for example.
